# Support-Net-India
An attempt at making a list of resources that may be useful for sexual abuse and domestic violence survivors in India.  These may not be the most perfect, but this is all I could find. Proceeding with caution is advisable since in some cases there is a chance that the people talking to you aren't sensitized enough to treat you with the dignity and respect that you deserve. Remember that you matter, and that if you are in a situation where you need to use this repository for yourself then **it is not your fault** that you ended up in this situation. **The people that hurt you are responsible for their actions, you are not.**
